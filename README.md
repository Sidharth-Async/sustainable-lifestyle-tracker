🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

Prerequisites

You will need the following installed:

    Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+

    Apache Maven

    Git

    (If you use a specific frontend framework, list its prerequisites here, e.g., Node.js/npm)

Installation and Setup

    Clone the repository:
    Bash

git clone https://github.com/Sidharth-Async/sustainable-lifestyle-tracker.git
cd sustainable-lifestyle-tracker

Backend Setup (Java/Spring Boot):

    Navigate to the backend directory (usually the root directory for Spring Boot).

    Configure your database settings in the application.properties or application.yml file under src/main/resources.

    Build the project:
    Bash

./mvnw clean install

Run the application:
Bash

    java -jar target/sustainable-lifestyle-tracker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Frontend Setup (If separate):

    If your frontend code is in a separate directory (e.g., frontend/), navigate to it.

    Install dependencies (adjust commands based on your framework):
    Bash

# Example for a Node.js-based frontend
npm install

Start the frontend development server:
Bash

        # Example command
        npm start

The backend usually starts on http://localhost:8080. Check your console output for the exact frontend URL (often http://localhost:3000).
